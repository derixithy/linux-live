# This is a config file for Linux Live Kit build script.
# You shouldn't need to change anything expect LIVEKITNAME

# Live Kit Name. Defaults to 'linux';
# This will be the name of the directory created on your CD/USB, which
# will contain everything including boot files and such.
# For example, Slax changes it to 'slax'
# Must not contain any spaces.
# If you change it, you must run ./tools/isolinux.bin.update script
# in order to update isolinux.bin for CD booting.
# If you do not need booting from CD (eg you're booting only from USB)
# then you can ignore recompiling isolinux.bin, just rename LIVEKITNAME
# and you're done.
LIVEKITNAME="CoffeeCupOS"

# Kernel file, will be copied to your Live Kit
# Your kernel must support aufs and squashfs. Debian Jessie's kernel is ready
# out of the box.
VMLINUZ=/init

# Kernel version. Change it to "3.2.28" for example, if you are building
# Live Kit with a different kernel than the one you are actually running
KERNEL=$(uname -r)

# List of directories which will be modularized
# No subdirectories are allowed, no slashes,
# so You can't use /var/tmp here for example
# Exclude directories like proc sys tmp
MKMOD="bin etc home lib lib64 opt root sbin srv usr var"

# List of files and directories you'd like to exclude from your Live Kit
EXCLUDE="/etc/fstab /etc/mtab"

# Temporary directory to store livekit filesystem
